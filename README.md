# Crypto Numismatics

Crypto Numismatics gives users a simple, convenient overview of their digital currency holdings. Registered users can build a portfolio of all their cryptocurrencies, whether mainstream or obscure, and update or delete their holdings at will. The dashboard displays current price and historical returns for each coin in a sortable table, as well as aggregate data for the entire portfolio. A donut chart representation of the user's asset allocation is also available.

Built with Next.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS.
